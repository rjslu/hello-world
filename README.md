Hello World!
My Name is RJ, and I am a code newbie, but working hard to become a self taught Web Developer!

I have been working on HTML, CSS, Javascript, consistently for around 1 year now but want to learn more and more every day. 
I am forever a student and enjoy learning new ideas and concepts.
